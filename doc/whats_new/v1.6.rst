- |Enhancement| Added zero division handling in :func:`metrics.balanced_accuracy_score`
  to make balanced accuracy consistent with macro-average recall.
  :pr:`28038` by :user:`Tenga Cortal <TengaCortal>`.

- |Fix| :func:`metrics.balanced_accuracy_score` does not ignore `nan` due to
  a division by zero when `y_pred` contains label not present in `y_true`.
  It is thus equal to the average recall per class in this case also.
  :pr:`28038` by :user:`Tenga Cortal <TengaCortal>`.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the maintenance and improvement of
the project since version 1.5, including:

TODO: update at the time of the release.
